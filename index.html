    <p>
      The Fireside Toolkit enables users to create multiplayer, text-based</br>
      games. Games include images and sounds of the users' choosing to</br>
      customize the experience. Games feature Attributes created by the</br>
      user that may be used to create a variable experience for the player;</br>
      choice-driven games with several different endings are easy to create</br>
      using the Fireside Toolkit.</br>
