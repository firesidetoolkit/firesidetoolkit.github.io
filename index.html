    <h1>Fireside Toolkit</h1>
    <p>
      The Fireside Toolkit enables users to create multiplayer, text-based</br>
      games. The toolkit was built in C# using Visual Studio and the SFML</br>
      Engine was adapted to run the users' creations. Games include images</br>
      and sounds of the users' choosing to customize the experience. Games</br>
      feature Attributes created by the user that may be used to create a</br>
      variable experience for the player; choice-driven games with several</br>
      different endings are easy to create using the Fireside Toolkit.</br>
