# Toolkit Support
Ready to make your own game or just trying to figure out how all this works? We're here to help!
Below, we take you through everything you're going to need to work with Fireside Toolkit.
If you're brand new to the toolkit, we advise you start from the top and read your way down!

## Getting Started
Upon opening the toolkit, you'll be met with a blank Project Home screen. Before you are three
lists: one for Hubs, one for Path Groups, and one for Paths (more on each below). Across the top, 
you will see "File," "Edit," and "Create..." drop down menus next to the "Run Playtest" Button.

### Starting a New Project
Click the "File" drop down menu. Click the "New..." button.
_Warning:_ Clicking this will remove everything in the currently open project. 
If you're working on an existing project, it is strongly urged that you save if 
you do not wish for any changes to be lost. After clicking the "New..." button, 
you will be in a new project.

### Saving a New Project or Copying a Project
Click the "File" drop down menu. Click the "Save As..." button. You will be prompted to select a 
directory to save your file in and to give the file a name. Your file will be given the ".fsp"
extension for "Fireside Project."

### Saving an Existing Project
Click the "File" drop down menu. Click the "Save" button. The toolkit will automatically update
your existing ".fsp" file.

### Loading a Project
Click the "File" drop down menu. Click the "Open..." button. You will be prompted to select the
directory of your desired ".fsp" file. Once there, select the file and the toolkit will open the
project!
