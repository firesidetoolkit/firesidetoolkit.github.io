## About Fireside Toolkit
The Fireside Toolkit enables users to create multiplayer, text-based
games. The toolkit was built in C# using Visual Studio and the SFML
Engine was adapted to run the users' creations. Games include images
and sounds of the users' choosing to customize the experience. Games
feature Attributes created by the user that may be used to create a
variable experience for the player; choice-driven games with several
different endings are easy to create using the Fireside Toolkit.
